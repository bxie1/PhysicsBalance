Fundamental objects {

		rigid body; very strong bit of matter like a diamond.
		fixture; binds a shape to a body
		constraint; like a pendulum; we pin to the wall.

		joints; several types; distance, revolute, etc

		world: a collection of bodies and constraints...
}

	Collision: defines shapes, broad-phase, collision functions/queries
	Dynamics: provides simulation world, bodies, fixtures, and joints.
